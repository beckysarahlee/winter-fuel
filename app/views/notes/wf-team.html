<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Research notes</h3>
<p><b>TVP 24th October 2019</b></p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>  Lack of trust that G4S have correctly screened the callers </li>
  <li>  Agents want to see the move date to compare it with qualifying week</li>
  <li>  Concern about genuine annex’</li>
  <li>  Agents currently determine if the caller is at fault,
        deciding if the payment is recoverable or non-recoverable </li>
  <li>  Agents would want to give a reason why if they rejected the referral</li>
  <li>  Replacing the manual letter tool would save time</li>
  <li>  Agents would normally do investigation into the people matched at the address</li>
  <li>  If eRefs came in together from the same address it would “kill 2 birds with one stone”</li>
  <li>  Could debt repayment be quicker and “cut out the middleman” of debt management</li>
  <li>  Current top-up letter lacks context</li>
</ul>
