<p>You may be able to get Winter Fuel Payment depending on where you live.<br>
<br>
If you live in Switzerland or a European Economic Area (EEA) country and you have a genuine and sufficient link to the UK, you may get a payment.<br>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  You can not get a payment if you live in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta,
  Portugal or Spain because the average winter temperature is higher than the warmest
  region of the UK.
</div>

<p>Call 0800 731 0160 to make a overseas claim for Winter Fuel Payment.</p>
